# Changelog

## v0.1.10 (2024-03-07)


## v0.1.9 (2024-02-29) - The Leap Release!

This adds support for Bumblebee as a Chat model, making it easy to have conversations with Llama 2, Mistral, and Zephyr LLMs.

See the documentation in `LangChain.ChatModels.ChatBumblebee` for getting started.

NOTE: That at this time, none of the models support the `function` ability, so that is not supported yet.

This release includes an experimental change for better support of streamed responses that are broken up over multiple messages from services like ChatGPT and others.

Other library dependencies requirements were relaxed, making it easier to support different versions of libraries like `req` and `nx`.

* Add mistral chat by @michalwarda in https://github.com/brainlid/langchain/pull/76
* handle receiving JSON data broken up over multiple messages by @brainlid in https://github.com/brainlid/langchain/pull/80
* Add initial support for Zephyr 7b Beta by @brainlid in https://github.com/brainlid/langchain/pull/41

## v0.1.8 (2024-02-16)

**Breaking change**: `RoutingChain`'s required values changed. Previously, `default_chain` was assigned an `%LLMChain{}` to return when no more specific routes matched.

This was changed to be `default_route`. It now expects a `%PromptRoute{}` to be provided.

Here's how to make the change:

      selected_route =
        RoutingChain.new(%{
          llm: ChatOpenAI.new(%{model: "gpt-3.5-turbo", stream: false}),
          input_text: user_input_text,
          routes: routes,
          default_route: PromptRoute.new!(%{name: "DEFAULT", chain: fallback_chain})
        })
        |> RoutingChain.evaluate()

The `default_chain` was changed to `default_route` and now expects a `PromptRoute` to be provided. The above example includes a sample default route that includes an optional `fallback_chain`.

Previously, the returned value from `RoutingChain.evaluate/1` was a `selected_chain`; it now returns the `selected_route`.

**Why was this changed?**

This was changed to make it easier to use a `PromptChain` when there isn't an associated `%LLMChain{}` for it. The application must just need the answer of which route was selected.

This includes the change of not requiring a `%PromptChain{}`'s `description` or `chain` field.
