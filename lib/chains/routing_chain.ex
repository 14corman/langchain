  # model to use for setting up the final RoutingChain.

  # Second layer sequential data extraction process?
  # - determine that it is "product post"
  # - run a 2nd (sequential) data extraction process to look for which product.
  #   If a specific product is found, load that product's data (Elixir code) and
  #   include it in the prompt.
  # - I'm concerned that trying to run the data extraction instructions AT THE
  #   SAME TIME as the route category classification may not work well? Could
  #   test it out and see how that would be structured.
  # - would support me working on activity, card, blog post, etc.

  # Alternative:
  # - a route links to a follow-up chain. Each follow-up chain can have a
  #   pre-defined model for that chain. It could link to a SequentialChain which
  #   could re-run another RoutingChain, a SequentialChain, or a normal chain.
  # - the DataExtraction chain's result would want Elixir code to process and
  #   handle what to do with the result. Like if no product/topic was found it
  #   might prompt to ask for that, take the response, then setup the full
  #   prompt chain.
  #
  # - would want an official "chain" behavior at that point.
